# graphganReader
Program to take in a "graphghan" chart (grid with colored boxes) and process the image in order to read the chart in alternating diagonals.

These diagonals are then turned into the pattern rows, and are printed out in plain text.

This project contains 5 test images, with varying color, shapes, and image quality to see what works best for as many as possible.
